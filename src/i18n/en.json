The Recruit tab is where you can send any Devs you control out to find new members to join your cause. Your Dev will always find one new member that belongs to one of two Teams: the Minnows, or the Whales, and will always be the same Faction of the Dev that Recruited them. It takes 24 hours for your Dev to return with a new member. Once you have sent your Dev out it will be staked for the rest of the Season."

Every time you give your Dev the order to Influence a particular Team, it will increase your chances of your Dev returning with a member of that Team by XXX%. Every time you give your Dev orders to Influence a particular Team you will see the number increase above that Team on the Recruit Influence page.<br/>If you change your mind about which Team you want to Influence you can select the other Team, and it will reset the Influence counter to 1 for your new target. You can give Influence orders to your Dev once every 1 hour."

For every unique Dev you control you will receive +0.05x to your <b>Global xp</b> multiplier as well as your Proposer xp.<br/><br/><b>The Whales</b> are the big bagged ones, they make splashes in DeFi. For every unique Whale you control you will receive +0.05x to your <b>Transaction Value</b> xp multiplier.<br/><br/><b>The Minnows</b> are small but plenty, what they lack in funds they make up for with activity.

During a Free Recruitment you will also be able to Influence the Team you get, but you do not have to Stake a Dev to do so. "
