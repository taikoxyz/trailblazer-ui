    question: 'How do the Faction badge multipliers work?',
    answer:
      'Each faction badge gives a 1.1x booster multiplier. Snaefel NFT holders get a 1.1x points boost, and Taikoons holders get a 2x points boost. If you sell your Faction badge(s) before the end of the season, you will lose the accumulated multiplied Experience Points by the number of Faction badges sold or moved from your wallet. For example, if youâ€™ve collected 8 badges, you have a 2.14x multiplier, but if you sell one, you will have a 1.95x XP multiplier. These multipliers will last for the entire Trailblazer program duration.',
