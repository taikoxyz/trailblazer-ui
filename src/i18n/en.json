If you sell your Faction badge(s) before the end of the season, you will lose the accumulated multiplied Experience Points by the number of Faction badges sold or moved from your wallet. For example, if you’ve collected 8 badges, you have a 2.14x multiplier, but if you sell one, you will have a 1.95x XP multiplier. These multipliers will last for the entire Trailblazer program duration.",

      "answer": "See Mirror article (https://taiko.mirror.xyz/589CthdX0Qw-hRBeZarEQpjck-v4lJ-gtKz3SZvovt8), we will consider the following activities to help you collect XPs:\n\n- Bridging (ETH)\n- Bridging (ERC20)\n- Transaction Volume\n- Transaction Count (any kind of transaction counts)\n- Block Proposals.\n\nThis means that providing liquidity will not give you any XPs.",
